# Banking Application Project
This application allows the user to deposit and withdraw money, as well as do transactions as a customer of the bank. Changing the value of money in their bank account. As the amount of money in their bank account changes, the membership level of their account will change as well, varying between silver, gold, and platinum. Depending on the level of membership, the user will receive discounts on purchases that can also be made through the app.

The user can also log in as a manager, who can add or remove customers and manage the bank application.
